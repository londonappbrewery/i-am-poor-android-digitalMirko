# i-am-poor-android-digitalMirko

Coding Challenge #1 - Using the Layout Editor in Android Studio and Github.
I downloaded a project. Then followed through the directions for the required elements.
I then put a few finishing touches on the project to add some life to it. Including a star filled forest at night with 
some shooting stars and a message between the explosion of stars to "Wish Upon A Star".

The message "I am Poor!" that was part of the class work along with the coal image were placed below in the bottom
portion of the app with the text of being poor on the piece of coal in a white color.
